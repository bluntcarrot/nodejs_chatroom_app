# Chat room application using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io

A chat room web application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. I started the application with the bare minimum requirements of
a chat room and have slowly added new features to learn and apply new skills.

Some of the features I will/have released are:

- Added an active user's list
- Currently logged in user is in bold text on the user's list
- Added a color picker to the login screen
- User's choice of color is applied to the text color all users see in the chat window
- A rough first release of private messaging has been added, still needs work
- Future release: Responsive/mobile friendly
- Future release: More advanced user customizable settings
- Future release: Modern UI
